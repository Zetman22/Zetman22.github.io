<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a research engineer at [Viettel AI](https://viettelai.vn/). Previously, I obtained the M.S. and B.S degrees in control engineering and automation at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam, in 2022 and 2024, respectively.

During my time at Sensor Lab at HUST, I gained significant research experience, particularly in machine learning for speech and signal processing. I previously worked on flexible and efficient representation learning for real-time speech enhancement, which resulted in several publications in prestigious journals, including IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, Applied Acoustics, and Measurement. I am currently working in industry, where I am responsible for developing several front-end processing systems for our company's products, such as wakeword detection, echo cancellation, speaker diarization, and speech extraction and enhancement for robust automatic speech recognition (ASR). 

## Research Interests

- Audio, Speech, and Signal Processing

[Advancing Robust Human Activity Recognition via Informative mmWave
Radar Characteristics and A Lightweight Spatio-Spectro-Temporal Network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224125014150)

Van Ngoc Dang, **Ngoc Chau Hoang**, Quoc Cuong Nguyen, Minh Thuy Le

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=3Xqm9JIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=3Xqm9JIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='UeHWp8X0CEIC'></span></strong> -->
- Developed a mmWave radar-based human activity recognition system that can adaptively model complex spatial dependencies among receivers, enabling it to distinguish the direction of body parts‚Äô movements. This is especially beneficial for recognizing activities performed along arbitrary trajectories.
